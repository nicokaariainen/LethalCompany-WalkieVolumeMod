# WalkieVolume mod

Allows the user to change the volume of the walkie talkies. Volume can be changed from the main menu or in game using the LethalConfig UI by AinaVT.

**NOTE! Currently you can only lower the volume from the default setting.**

## Installation

#### Automatic
Install using the r2modman which will also install all dependencies automatically.

#### Manual

2. Copy the WalkieVolume.dll file inside the "plugins" folder to the BepInEx "plugins" folder.


## Planned features

- Allow the user to increase the walkie talkie volume.
